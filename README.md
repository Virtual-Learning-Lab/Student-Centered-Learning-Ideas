# Student-Centered-Learning-Ideas
Here you can work on ideas and rules before they are implemented in [General.pdf](https://github.com/Virtual-Learning-Lab/Student-Centered-Learning/blob/main/The%20System/General.pdf) file.

## Working in this directory
1. DO NOT edit README.md you will get banned.
2. When you create an idea make sure you put the file in the [Ideas](test.com) folder and give your file a meaningful name.
3. Only edit your own files unless you have permission from a the creator of that file to edit it.
4. Make sure you provide sources for your information.
5. When you have finished working on your idea/rule and you want it to end up in the [General.pdf](https://github.com/Virtual-Learning-Lab/Student-Centered-Learning/blob/main/The%20System/General.pdf) file. You need to make a post in [r/StudentCenteredLearnin](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentCenteredLearin/) with a link to the file of your idea and a poll with the option yes and no and the tag IDEA. The poll length is 7 days. If after 7 days more then 60% of people voted YES your idea will be implemented into the [General.pdf](https://github.com/Virtual-Learning-Lab/Student-Centered-Learning/blob/main/The%20System/General.pdf) file.
